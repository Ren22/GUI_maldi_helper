An interactive GUI to process ablation mark regions on single cell data pipeline.
To import numpy array or image in different formats such as PNG, TIFF, etc. choose
"File -> Open"
Select the area of interest by clicking on the uploaded data in GUI (a red rectangle will appear which you can pull and adjust its size).
After that you can either crop the area of interest or delete selected area.
The file can be then saved by:
"Save as ->" which allows to specify file name and its format
"Save ->" will overwrite the existing file
